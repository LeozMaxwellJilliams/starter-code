## Choosing a Backend
We provide two options for your project's backend.
### Option 1: Firebase + Cloud Firestore (NoSQL)
Firebase is Google's Backend-as-a-Service. It provides the following:
- Hosting  
    Website hosting. Provides a custom domain name and SSL.
- Cloud Firestore  
    A NoSQL database.
- Cloud Functions  
    Scripts that run on Firebase when triggered by an event. For example, run a 
    script that sends an email whenever a new user is created in the DB.
- Authentication  
    User authentication. Supports email+password, Facebook, Google, and more.
- Cloud Storage  
    Stores static assets such as PDFs, images, videos, files, etc.
